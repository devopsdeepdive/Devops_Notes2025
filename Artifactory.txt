Maven:
apt-get install openjdk-11-jre-headless
java -version
 apt-get install maven
 mvn --version

maven : pom.xml
goals:

1. clean
Maven also has standard phases for cleaning the project and for generating a project site. If cleaning were part of the default lifecycle, the project would be cleaned every time it was built. This is clearly undesirable, so cleaning has been given its own lifecycle.

2.site
3. default:
validate
compile
test
package: jar , war ,ear
java arch , web arch , ear=enterprise arch
install 
deploy
